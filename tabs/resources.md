## Malware Analysis Platforms
These are images, VM's, or scripts to build out a VM that is suitable to reverse engineer or otherwise deal with analyzing malware.  Granted, you can build your own (I did for a long time) but being able to automate the creation of an environment in minimal time has proven to be more valuable.
