<h2 style="padding-top: 1.2rem;">Early on...</h2>
I started my career in the 1990's on an 8088 writing batch scripts and learning assembly language. I stumbled across a wonderful kernel debugger called SoftICE of which changed everything, this was my first venture into reverse engineering.

Since then, I became a programmer in a variety of languages from C/C++ to C# to Python.  I spent many years in the military and working in DoD environments and transitioning into a Cybersecurity mindset which led into security focused programmer positions.

## Later
In more recent years I moved into full Cybersecurity work.  I've been in positions where I have been wearing all the hats in small Cybersecurity teams and have now moved into more focused Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) work.

## Incident Response and Malware Reverse Engineering
My focus now is on the CSIRT process and becoming a better reverse engineer of Malware.  The intent of this blog site is to stay focused on that specifically and to post my notes and learnings along the way as I progress.
