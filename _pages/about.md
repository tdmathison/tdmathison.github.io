I am a software developer, penetration tester, OSCP, OSCE, and hobbiest blacksmith.  I spend time investigating security related issues and attemping to understand and exploit security vulnerabilities.  This site will capture some of my experiences, pentest and CTF walkthroughs, and articles/whitepapers that I write.<br/><br/>
