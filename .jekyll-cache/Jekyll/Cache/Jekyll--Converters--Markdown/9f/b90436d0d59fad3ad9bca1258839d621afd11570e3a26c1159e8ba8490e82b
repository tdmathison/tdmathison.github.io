<p>I have been a developer for longer than I can remember (over 20 years), interested in hacking and the security side of things for much of it as well.  However, it wasnâ€™t until relatively recently (3 or so years) that I started to consider an actual pivot away from every day development into more of a security focused type of role.  It didnâ€™t take too long to realize that the Offensive Security training was what I was looking for.</p>
